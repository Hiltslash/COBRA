keywords:
cvar (creates variables)

show (prints to the screen)

cal (computes calculations)

input (takes input from the user)

for (repeats a command a number of times)
if (control flow)

declare variables with cvar name value

print things with show ""

print variables with show "var varname"

do calculations like this: cal 5 * 4 resultvariable

take input like this: input variablename "text to display"

File extension must be .coil for cobra

do a for loop like this: for times command arguments

make an infinite loop like this: for 10 for 10 for 10 for 10 for 10 for 10 show "this will loop forever :D"
if statements like this: if condition exresult command argument(s)


yes that's kinda the entire documentation
