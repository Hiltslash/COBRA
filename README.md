# COBRA
Custom Programming language built in python. Can you even imagine how slow it is?

i'm bored
that's the only reason this exists.
yes it runs at approximatley 1 fps
yes it has bugs.
just a goofy little project.
have a good day/night!

keywords:
cvar (creates variables)

show (prints to the screen)

cal (computes calculations)

input (takes input from the user)

for (repeats a command a number of times)


if (control flow)

clear

wait

goto

systemsay

systemdial


declare variables with cvar name value

print things with show ""

print variables with show "var varname"

do calculations like this: cal 5 * 4 resultvariable

take input like this: input variablename "text to display"

File extension must be .coil for cobra

do a for loop like this: for times command arguments

wait for a while like this: wait seconds

Go to a specific line like this: goto linenumber

if statements like this: if "var name" "Beau"

end if statements with :end.

oh my goodness functions were tedious to make

write them like this: func functioname arguments linenumber

its the ugliest code i've ever written

make your computer talk like this: systemsay "Message"

create a popup like this: systemdial "Message" "type" "result variable" (put none if it's not yes/no or ok)

*Another note: when clearing the screen with clear, you have to put something after it. anything, it dosent matter.*
