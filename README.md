# COBRA
Custom Programming language built in python. Can you even imagine how slow it is?

i'm bored
that's the only reason this exists.
yes it runs at approximatley 1 fps
yes it has bugs.
just a goofy little project.

keywords:
cvar (creates variables)

show (prints to the screen)

cal (computes calculations)

input (takes input from the user)

for (repeats a command a number of times)


if (control flow)

clear

wait

declare variables with cvar name value

print things with show ""

print variables with show "var varname"

do calculations like this: cal 5 * 4 resultvariable

take input like this: input variablename "text to display"

File extension must be .coil for cobra

do a for loop like this: for times command arguments

wait for a while like this: wait seconds

make an infinite loop like this: for 10 for 10 for 10 for 10 for 10 for 10 show "this will loop forever :D"
if statements like this: if condition exresult command argument(s)

Another note: when clearing the screen with clear, you have to put something after it. anything, it dosent matter.




## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Make the script executable: chmod -x cobra
3. Add repo to your path:  export PATH="/path/to/cobra:$PATH" Add it to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to make it permenant
4. Test it with "cobra example.coil"

yes that's kinda the entire documentation
