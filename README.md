keywords:
cvar (creates variables)
show (prints to the screen)
cal (computes calculations)
input (takes input from the user)

declare variables with cvar name value
print things with show ""
print variables with show "var varname"
do calculations like this: cal 5 * 4 resultvariable
take input like this: input variablename "text to display"
File extension must be .coil for cobra

yes that's kinda the entire documentation
